User Guide for ZipCodeProject 2.0
---------------------------------
1. Introduction

   This project processes Zip Code and Place Name data from a CSV file, organizing it by state and finding:
    - Easternmost Zip Code/Place Name (least longitude)
    - Westernmost Zip Code/Place Name (greatest longitude)
    - Southernmost Zip Code/Place Name (least latitude)
    - Northernmost Zip Code/Place Name (greatest latitude)

### This is basically Part 1's information, no mention of Part 2 stuff

-----
2. Converter Program (Part 1)

   To compile the converter, enter this command:
   "g++ -o converter CSVConverterMain.cpp CSVConverter.cpp HeaderBuffer.cpp"
   
   To run enter this command:
   "./converter"

### Include information about what the converter program does and the output.
### Include the information on how the headers work

-----
3. Zip Processor Program (Part 1)

   To compile the table creation program, enter this command:
   "g++ -o zip_processor main.cpp Buffer.cpp HeaderBuffer.cpp"

   To run enter this command:
   "./zip_processor"

   Upon running, the user will be prompted as such:
   "Do you want to sort by Zip Code (Z) or Place Name (P): "

   This allows for the user to specify whether the data should be sorted by Zip Code or Place Name.
   If the user does not enter 'Z' or 'P' (not case sensitive), the program will continue prompting the user.

   If there is missing data in the input CSV file, the user will receive warnings like such:
   "Warning: Missing county on line: 96940, Palau, PW,,7.2257,134.3622"
    
   The results are written to:
    - SortedLocations.txt (formatted text output)
    - SortedLocations.csv (CSV output)

   Termination message upon program completion:
   'Output written to SortedLocations.txt and SortedLocations.csv'

### Should be more a bit more information on what this program does

-----
4. Zip Indexing Programs (Part 2)

### Include any information that would be useful to the user about the zip indexing programs



-----
5. Documentation

### Include information about the various types of documentation that we will do.
   Documentation done through Doxygen can be seen in 'DoxygenPDF.pdf'
